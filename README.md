üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
Upload PDF: The user uploads a PDF file through a file uploader in the app interface.

Text Extraction: The app uses the PyMuPDFLoader to extract the text from the PDF.

Vector Store: The extracted text is indexed in a FAISS vector store for fast similarity search.

Ask Questions: After processing the PDF, users can input a question, and the system uses Google Gemini to retrieve relevant text from the PDF and generate an answer.

Display Results: The app displays the answer along with source snippets from the PDF that led to the response.
